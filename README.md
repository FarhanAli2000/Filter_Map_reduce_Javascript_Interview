🚀 Introduction:

Manipulating arrays is a crucial skill for JavaScript developers. This project dives deep into the filter, map, and reduce methods, offering explanations and hands-on examples to illustrate their functionality.

🔍 Array Methods:

filter

The filter method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function. It does not alter the original array.

map

The map method generates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It also leaves the original array unchanged.

reduce

The reduce method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It’s perfect for accumulating results or performing calculations.

🛠️ Usage

You can utilize these methods in your projects by importing the JavaScript file and calling the functions on your arrays.
